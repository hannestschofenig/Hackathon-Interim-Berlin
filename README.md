We are planning to do some interoperability testing between the SUIT manifest (draft spec) implementations offered by different groups. We also plan to work on foundational building blocks together (e.g. COSE implementation etc.).  Since the hackathon at IETF 101 in London, Inria and FU Berlin have released a new COSE implementation, and ARM have released firmware update code.
